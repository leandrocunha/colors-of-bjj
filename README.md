# colors-of-bjj READMEa

## Roadmap project
The first approach of it was create a theme based on my passion, the Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, but I didn't consider or measure how hard it's. The first implementation is the current that you can find at VSCode Marketplace, and it's a really early stage with a lot o bugs and missing language support. I'm a frontend developer so basically I just create this version for the Javascript files.

After a few months demotivated, I decide to move again with the project but at this time I got a few steps back to learn a bit how the theme works under the hood, and then I will create the same theme but with variations. This variations will ne based on BJJ Belts: white, blue, purple, brown and black.

- [ ] White Belt version - not started
- [x] Blue Belt version - under development
- [ ] Purple Belt version - not started
- [ ] Brown Belt version - not started
- [ ] Black Belt version - not started

### Current stage
Currently the Blue Belt version is under development and you can find it under blue-belt branch. Check below the steps that I'm planning to follow:
- [x] Define base colors
- [ ] Basic colorscheme for javascript/typescript (under development)
- [ ] Add colorscheme for HTML
- [ ] Add colorscheme for CSS
- [ ] Add colorscheme to VSCode - finish the theme

## Motivation
For years I've be using Dracula Theme, and I'm really fan of it and a few time ago I decided try something new just to "refresh" my eye in my daily code life. Instead just install a new one from VSCode Marketplace -- I tried -- I wondering why not have some fun and create a new from scratch. I've a entrepeneur spirit and I really like to create things, simple like that. ;)
